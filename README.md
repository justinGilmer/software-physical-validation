# Best Practices for Simulation Software Validation / Physical Validation

Best Practices articles treating simulation software validation and
physical validation, to be submitted to LiveCoMS (Living Journal of
Computational Molecular Science, [www.livecomsjournal.org](http://www.livecomsjournal.org)).
We plan to divide the topic into two largely independent documents:

1. Best practices for simulation software testing (developer best practices)
2. Best practices for physical validation of simulation results (user best practices)

The groundwork for these articles was laid during the Best Practices
workshop organized by Michael Shirts on behalf of MolSSI, held at NIST
on Aug 24-25, 2017, by
Justin Gilmer,
David Kofke,
Pascal Merz,
Conor Parks,
Julia Rice, 
Matthew Spellings,
Terry Stouch, and
William Swope 
(authors in alphabetical order).
