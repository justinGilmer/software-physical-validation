# Best Practices for Simulation Software Validation / Physical Validation

Best Practices articles treating simulation software validation and
physical validation, to be submitted to LiveCoMS (Living Journal of
Computational Molecular Science, [www.livecomsjournal.org](http://www.livecomsjournal.org)).
We plan to divide the topic into two largely independent documents:

1. Best practices for simulation software verification (developer best practices)
2. Best practices for physical validation of simulation results (user best practices)

The groundwork for these articles was laid during the Best Practices
workshop organized by Michael Shirts on behalf of MolSSI, held at NIST
on Aug 24-25, 2017, by Justin Gilmer, David Kofke, Pascal Merz, Conor
Parks, Julia Rice, Matthew Spellings, Terry Stouch, and William Swope
(authors in alphabetical order). _Please contact Pascal Merz if you
would like to contribute but have not been invited to do so._


### Best practices for simulation software verification 
*Scope:* The authors are experts on simulation software, not
necessarily on general software engineering. Consequently, the scope
of the article will not be general software engineering best practices
(version control, continuous integration, unit/system/regression
testing, ...), but the testing of _simulation_ software. We will
propose a hierarchically organized set of tests intended to help
developers to detect and localize errors in simulation software.

### Best practices for physical validation of simulation results
*Scope:* A checklist of methods to analyze whether simulation results
fulfill basic physical validity, including checks of the sampled
ensemble, the equipartition principle, conservation / drift of
constants, correlation times (to be extended).
